sublime-lu-squirrel
================

Adds squirrel support to Sublime Text 2 with Liberty Unleashed functions.

Note: I'm not entirely finished with this. I also really don't have idea what I am doing... so if I was you, I'd expect this
to be entirely wrong but lucky at least some of it is right thanks to [Micheg's sublime_squirrel](https://github.com/micheg/sublime_squirrel)
