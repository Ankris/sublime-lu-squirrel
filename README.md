================

Adds squirrel support to Sublime Text 2 with Liberty Unleashed functions. Liberty Unleashed is a Grand Theft Auto 3 Multiplayer mod ([site](http://liberty-unleashed.co.uk/))

**Note:** When I first started this I really didn't have any idea what I awas doing... so if I was you, I'd expect this
to be entirely wrong but lucky at least some of it is right thanks to [Micheg's sublime_squirrel](https://github.com/micheg/sublime_squirrel).
