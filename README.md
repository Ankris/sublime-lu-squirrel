Squirrel Programming Language support for Sublime Text 2

NOTE:
-----

This is a preliminary version for support the squirrel programming language on Sublime Text 2.
(This version is a bit based on an old Boundle for TextMate.)

sublime_squirrel currently supports only on OSX and Linux. (I'm sorry but I do not have a Windows machine)

There are 2 ways to install it.

* Git Clone

Go to your Sublime Text 2 Packages directory:

OS X: ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages
Linux: ~/.Sublime Text 2/Packages/
and clone the repository using the command below:

        git clone https://github.com/micheg/sublime_squirrel.git Squirrel

* File Download

Head to the downloads section and unzipping the downloaded file into the Sublime Text 2 Packages directory, then rename it Squirrel
